# Solve 

on opening the website we are greeted with this image :

![alt text](assets/wau.png) 

and a text.

- so we capture the request in burp and change the user-agent to `PicoBrowser`
- next the site tells me that "I dont trust users from other websites"

- So, I added a referer header `Referer: mercury.picoctf.net:38322`, adding the website as its own referer.

- next we are given  "Sorry this site only worked in 2018", So i added a date header `Date: Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:31:12 GMT`

- next we get :  "I dont trust users who can be tracked".

- so we add a  do not track header `DNT: 1`

- next prompt : "The website is only for people from Sweden", so i changed the location and language to Sweden and Swedish, 
`Accept-Language: sv-sv,sv;q=0.5` and `X-Forwarded-For: 51.59.121.34`.

With all of these headers in place, i finally got the flag.

**Final Payload**
```

Thus we get the flag :
