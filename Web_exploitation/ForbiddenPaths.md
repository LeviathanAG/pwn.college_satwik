## Forbidden Paths 
Since it is given that the flag is in the directory `/usr/share/nginx/html/ ` and the flag existed in the directory `/flag`. Since absolute files don't work you have to use a relative path.
The website contains a prompt that reads the file of whatever relative path is inputted. Therefore if you input `../../../../flag.txt`, we get the flag.

flag: `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5a6fcbc}`
