## Changing File Ownership
### Solve 
The flag : `pwn.college{8TlncH2glZvroGChUbgoECrcszV.dFTM2QDLzQjN0czW}`

In this challenge, we have to change the owner of the `/flag` file as the `hacker` user in order to access the flag and hence get it. 


* The `chown` command can typically only be used by the `root` user.

 * I run `chown hacker /flag` to change the owner of `/flag` as `hacker`. 

 * Then I run `cat /flag` to print out the flag as I can access it now.



```
Connected!
hacker@permissions~changing-file-ownership:~$ chown hacker /flag
hacker@permissions~changing-file-ownership:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{8TlncH2glZvroGChUbgoECrcszV.dFTM2QDLzQjN0czW}
hacker@permissions~changing-file-ownership:~$

```

## Groups and files

### Solve 

The flag : 

`pwn.college{EIoePM9YgSCnDiYOKcewpE-6tdK.dFzNyUDLzQjN0czW}`

In this challenge, the `/flag` file is owned by `root` user and only members of the `root` group can access it. We need to change the group owner to `hacker` in order to access it.


* The `chgroup` command can be used to change group ownership. It can typically only be used by the `root` user.

I run `chgrp hacker /flag` to change the group ownership. 

Then I run `cat /flag` to print the flag.



## Fun With Group Names

### Solve 
the flag :  - `pwn.college{MVOePAS9QWfhihd73-PooRtlZfC.dJzNyUDLzQjN0czW}`

In this challenge, we need to change the group owner of the file `/flag` to the group which our user `hacker` belongs to, in order to get our flag

I use the `id` command to find out which group `hacker` belongs to :
 
 ```
 hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ id
uid=1000(hacker) gid=1000(grp25662) groups=1000(grp25662)
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$
```
The group `hacker` belongs to is `grp25662` so I run `chgrp grp25662 /flag` to change the group ownership.

Finally I run `cat /flag` to get the flag.


## Changing Permissions

### Solve 

flag :

`pwn.college{YyaKeYmU8yUJM-sbhbrnloB5F-8.dNzNyUDLzQjN0czW}`


In this challenge, we need to modify the permissions of the file `/flag` in order to get our flag.


* `chmod` allows you to tweak permissions with the mode format of `WHO+/-WHAT`, where `WHO` is user/group/other and `WHAT` is read/write/execute.

I run `chmod o+r /flag` to allow all the users to read the file. 

Then I run `cat /flag` to print out the flag.

## Executable Files

### Solve 

flag : 
`pwn.college{kXm7Cw0wI_vyq4ht5830eXRPkly.dJTM2QDLzQjN0czW}`

In this challenge, we need to modify the permissions of the file `/flag` in order to get our flag.

* The file is owned by `hacker` but the owner doesn't have execution permissions so we can run `chmod u+x /challenge/run` to give the owner permission to run the file.

Then I run `/challenge/run` which gives me the flag.

```
Connected!
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ chmod u+x /challenge/run
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ /challenge/run
Successful execution! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{kXm7Cw0wI_vyq4ht5830eXRPkly.dJTM2QDLzQjN0czW}
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$


```

## Permission Tweaking Practice

### solve

flag - `pwn.college{EYcfK6GrQnQTRUZnKAhlEWWt6_l.dBTM2QDLzQjN0czW}`


We need to change the permissions of the /challenge/pwn file in specific ways a few times in a row in order to get our flag.

**Round 0:**
```
Current permissions of "/challenge/pwn": rw-r--r--
Needed permissions of "/challenge/pwn": rw-rw-r--
```
I run `chmod g+w /challenge/pwn` to set the required permissions

**Round 1:**
```
Current permissions of "/challenge/pwn": rw-rw-r--
Needed permissions of "/challenge/pwn": ------r--
```
I run `chmod ug-rw /challenge/pwn` to set the required permissions

**Round 2:**
```
Current permissions of "/challenge/pwn": ------r--
Needed permissions of "/challenge/pwn": ------rw-
```
I run `chmod o+w /challenge/pwn` to set the required permissions

**Round 3:**
```
Current permissions of "/challenge/pwn": ------rw-
Needed permissions of "/challenge/pwn": ---------
```
I run `chmod o-rw /challenge/pwn` to set the required permissions

**Round 4:**
```
Current permissions of "/challenge/pwn": ---------
Needed permissions of "/challenge/pwn": rwxrwxrwx
```
I run `chmod ugo+rwx /challenge/pwn` to set the required permissions

**Round 5:**
```
Current permissions of "/challenge/pwn": rwxrwxrwx
Needed permissions of "/challenge/pwn": -w--w-rwx
```
I run `chmod u-rx,g-rx /challenge/pwn` to set the required permissions

**Round 6:**
```
Current permissions of "/challenge/pwn": -w--w-rwx
Needed permissions of "/challenge/pwn": -w-rw-rwx
```
I run `chmod g+r /challenge/pwn` to set the required permissions

**Round 7:**
```
Current permissions of "/challenge/pwn":  -w-rw-rwx
Needed permissions of "/challenge/pwn":  -wxrwxrwx
```
I run `chmod u+x,g+x /challenge/pwn` to set the required permissions

Finally I run `chmod u+r /flag` to make the flag readable and run `cat /flag` to get the flag - `pwn.college{EYcfK6GrQnQTRUZnKAhlEWWt6_l.dBTM2QDLzQjN0czW}`

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions

## The SUID Bit

### Solve

 Flag : `pwn.college{cqiBcOeZICZy1YsAtko9rw4Ws2G.dNTM2QDLzQjN0czW}`

In this challenge, we need to add the SUID bit to `/challenge/getroot` in order to spawn a root shell where we can `cat` out the file.

I run `chmod u+s /challenge/getroot` to add the SUID bit. Then I run `/challenge/getroot` to spawn the root shell.

Finally I run `cat /flag` to get the flag.

```
Connected!
hacker@permissions~the-suid-bit:~$ chmod u+s /challenge/getroot
hacker@permissions~the-suid-bit:~$ /challenge/getroot
SUCCESS! You have set the suid bit on this program, and it is running as root!
Here is your shell...
root@permissions~the-suid-bit:~# cat /glag
cat: /glag: No such file or directory
root@permissions~the-suid-bit:~# cat /flag
pwn.college{cqiBcOeZICZy1YsAtko9rw4Ws2G.dNTM2QDLzQjN0czW}
root@permissions~the-suid-bit:~#


```
