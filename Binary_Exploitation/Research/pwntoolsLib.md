# basic pwntools methods that help with bin exp.

`from pwn import *` - imports everything

`ipython` - useful for testing binaries

`r=process('./x')` - useful for connecting to local binary

`r.send()` - to send inputs

`r.cyclic()` - for cyclic patterns to determine the correct amount of offset required to overwrite something for every four bytes.

we can again query ipython to get the exact byte offset

# Misc commands

`objdump -d -M intel <your_binary_file>`
