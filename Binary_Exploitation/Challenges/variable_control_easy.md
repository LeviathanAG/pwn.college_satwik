Our stack pointer points to 0x7ffcdf50c1c0, and our base pointer points to 0x7ffcdf50c250.
This means that we have (decimal) 20 8-byte words in our stack frame,
including the saved base pointer and the saved return address, for a
total of 160 bytes.
The input buffer begins at 0x7ffcdf50c1f0, partway through the stack frame,
("above" it in the stack are other local variables used by the function).
Your input will be read into this buffer.
The buffer is 75 bytes long, but the program will let you provide an arbitrarily
large input length, and thus overflow the buffer.

In this level, there is a "win" variable.
By default, the value of this variable is zero.
However, if you can set variable to 0x5d6e8736, the flag will be printed.
You can change this variable by overflowing the input buffer, but keep endianness in mind!
The "win" variable is stored at 0x7ffcdf50c23c, 76 bytes after the start of your input buffer.

 But be careful! There is also a LOSE variable. If this variable ends up non-zero, the program will terminate and you
will not get the flag. Be careful not to overwrite this variable.

The "lose" variable is stored at 0x7ffcdf50c240, 80 bytes after the start of your input buffer.

We have disabled the following standard memory corruption mitigations for this challenge:
- the binary is *not* position independent. This means that it will be
located at the same spot every time it is run, which means that by
analyzing the binary (using objdump or reading this output), you can
know the exact value that you need to overwrite the return address with.

You have chosen to send 4096 bytes of input!
This will allow you to write from 0x7ffcdf50c1f0 (the start of the input buffer)
right up to (but not including) 0x7ffcdf50d1f0 (which is 4021 bytes beyond the end of the buffer).
Send your payload (up to 4096 bytes)!

```


`Challenge is pretty simple we send 76 bytes of input to overflow the into the variable then send 4 byte integer value. lets try this first and then we will see the binary in pwngdb to actually see the $rsp and how we can use cyclic to calcualte offset properly`

The program's memory status:
- the input buffer starts at 0x7ffec49b3330
- the saved frame pointer (of main) is at 0x7ffec49b3390
- the saved return address (previously to main) is at 0x7ffec49b3398
- the saved return address is now pointing to 0x4025e3.
- the canary is stored at 0x7ffec49b3388.
- the canary value is now 0xd9c2359e3b391600.
- the address of the win variable is 0x7ffec49b337c.
- the value of the win variable is 0x5d6e8736.
- the address of the lose variable is 0x7ffec49b3380.
- the value of the lose variable is 0x0.

You win! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{shaNmWIrSI4ERMya_sZpFWlu2Yu.ddTNzMDLzQjN0czW}


Goodbye!
```

- we are basically just overriding the win variable with a non zero integer filling up 76-79th bytes and not touching the other bytes to get the flag.
now lets look at the hard challenge.

# The flag :

`pwn.college{shaNmWIrSI4ERMya_sZpFWlu2Yu.ddTNzMDLzQjN0czW} `      

# mitigation :

this issue can be prevented by proper input sanitisation and always keeping track of size of input.
